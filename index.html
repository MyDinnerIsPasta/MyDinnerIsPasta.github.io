        <p>This is the one of the programming project developed outside school work.

        <p>
		This program is to calculate the debt and show how much is the interest and remaining amount based on user input.
		This program asks users to put debt amount, interest rate, interest interval, and type of interest.
		This project currently supports only yearly interval with simple interest. 
		However, this program is designed to support all yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily interest with both simple and compound interest.
		It will be updated on Github.

        <p>Once user enters the all the debt information, the program asks user to enter paid amount for each interval.
		In this example, $20 is entered for each interval to see interest amount change.

        <p>When the user decides to quit or the amound reaches zero, This program shows summary of the payments.
		It starts with showing the information the user entered: debt amount, rate, type of interest, and interval of interest.
		It shows how much paid, the remaining of the principle, interest amount of each interval, total amount of interest, and lastly total amount of debt.</p>
